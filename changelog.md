| 13. | Added consistent figure numbers, titles, and captions to all diagrams (e.g., functional flows, ERD, UI mockups). Replaced raw image file names with labeled references (e.g., Figure 3.1: Student Check-In Process Flow). | 23-6-2025; 11.30pm | Tang Wei Xiong | To fix Documentation Defect DD-04: Missing or inconsistent labels reduced clarity and professionalism in the SRS, and made cross-referencing harder.|
